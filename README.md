## Overview
This app is a website that you can search all the Google books by the title or arthur of the book. The website is set up to have a form for users to input the title or the arthur of the book they want to search for. Then the website uses Google Book API to search for the books. The search result shows the book title and the arthur of the books the users searched. The search results will be saved in database to reduce the number of times the Google Book API is run. The app is built with a local server that uses EJS to render html files.

## Getting Started

## Architecture
This app is built by HTML, CSS, JavaScirpt, Express.js, EJS, PG, Superagent, and Google Book API.
